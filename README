index.html
The file index.html calls a javascript function to refresh the iframe
containing the html code in wsd.html. It also contains Google Analytics
code to track the site.


The python script wsd.py retrieves a random number from 
random.org, and rewrites wsd.csv. Two-hundred pairs of the
form "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, #.##" are written to wsd.csv.
The output is formatted using a money formatting routine 
obtained from python.org.  The python library randomdotorg must 
be installed for wsd.py. 

Prerequisites:
pip install randomdotorg
bootstrap html5,css,js library
jquery
dygraph


wsd.sh

calls wallstdollar and writes wsd.html. The crontab line is
*/3 * * * * /var/www/html/wsd/wsd.sh
