    <h1>The Wall Street Dollar (W<sub>$</sub>)</h1>
    <h2>The currency for exposure to conflict-of-interest risk</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
  Wall Street says it wants government to stay out of its business,
  but Wall Street really wants government to give it business.
  The Street depends on government to print its currency 
  and set monetary policy.  Since Wall Street cannot live
  with any regulation, despite privileged access to a sovereign 
  currency, market logic dictates that Wall Street create its own 
  currency: the Wall Street Dollar (WSD, symbol: W<sub>$</sub>).

      Proprietary trading, investment rating, financial executive compensation,

      Currently, the Wall Street Dollar 
      tracks <a href="http://www.random.org/">atmospheric noise</a>. 
      If common sense prevails, a global 24/7 exchange will be created for 
      Wall Street Dollars.  Main Street will have the USD, Wall Street 
      will have the WSD,  and the Fed will slam the discount window shut 
      on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banking_system">shadow banking system</a> for good.

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
      <h4>How would securitizing conflict-of-interest risk stabilize financial
          markets and institutionalize ethical behavior?</h4>
      <p>
      The Wall Street Dollar enables conflict-of-interest 
      risk to be priced explicitly, and can be hedged against when needed. 
      This will provide institutional incentives to encourage ethical 
      behavior. Paying executive compensation in Wall Street Dollars 
      will ensure a favorable exchange rate for the Wall Street Dollar. 
      Creating a currency and an exchange to insure against negative 
      externalities inherent in financial markets is a pragmatic approach to 
      regulating them.  
      </p>
      <h4>Why would anyone use Wall Street Dollars?</h4>
      <p>
      Financial institutions would be required to use the WSD for proprietary 
      trading, investment rating, executive compensation, and political 
      contributions. This would provide a market for Wall Street Dollars.
      </p>

      <h4>Who would guarantee the Wall Street Dollar?</h4>
      <p>
      The WSD will be backed by the full faith and credit of Wall Street--not 
      the United States government. Wall Street could pay a credit ratings
      agency in WSD for a triple-A rating, and the price of WSD would
      reflect this.
      </p>
      <h4>What about bank holding company access to the Fed discount window?</h4>
      <p>
      Some investment banks were converted to bank holding companies
      so they could be given access to the Federal Reserve Bank discount
      window. This access would be phased out with the conversion to 
      Wall Street Dollars. 
      </p>
      <h4>Will the FDIC continue to insure the bonds of bailed out financial institutions?</h4>
      <p>
      The FDIC insured the bonds of bailed out financial institutions through 
      programs such as the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/tlgp/index.html">Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program</a> (TLGP). 
      Without this guarantee, no one would purchase the debt of a bailed 
      out institution. Special programs such as the TLGP, which are funded 
      with US Dollars, would be phased out with the conversion to the 
      Wall Street Dollar.    
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
      <h4>How will the Wall Street Dollar affect taxpayers?</h4>
      <p>
      Main Street would be relieved of the necessity to maintain US Dollar 
      reserves for a systemic collapse of the financial markets.
      Taxpayers could buy Wall Street Dollars if the probability of a bank 
      bailout is low,  and short them if the probability of a bailout is high. 
      Vanilla stocks and bonds, which don't make money for Wall Street, 
      will continue to be traded in US Dollars. Comparison of stock and bond 
      prices in Wall Street Dollars versus US Dollars would inform investors 
      about their exposure to conflict-of-interest risk in these securities. 
      </p>

      <h4>What does the Wall Street dollar mean for investment banks?</h4>
      <p>
      The Wall Street Dollar Mint would provide a source of investment
      bank bailout funds. The global 24/7 WSD exchange would provide 
      a source of new markets. For example, securities valuation would 
      benefit through the explicit inclusion of conflict-of-interest 
      risk in pricing models. 
      </p>

      <h4>What if the Fed were to close the discount window to investment banks?</h4>
      <p>
      In the absence of a conversion to Wall Street Dollars, if the 
      institutions converted to bank holding companies were denied access 
      to the Fed discount window, and if the FDIC ceased insuring their bonds,
      their stocks would probably drop to zero within a week.
      </p>
      <h4>Why not just short the stock of a bank that is about to be bailed out?</h4>
      <p>
      Because it is more efficient to shift exposure to conflict-of-interest 
      risk to a currency and exchange designed to contain and allocate it. 
      Stock prices need not reflect conflict-of-interest risk: front-running 
      would be pointless if they did.  Shorting bank stocks will not 
      provide bailout funds if banks need to be recapitalized.
      </p>

      <h4>How would the WSD exchange deter speculation in US Dollars?</h4>
      <p>
      A number of proposals are under consideration. 
      Cross-currency swaps could be prohibited.  Random numbers could be 
      used to introduce small unpredictable delays into the transaction 
      processing of the WSD exchange to ensure fairness and to 
      thwart high-frequency trading and front-running.
